# Open questions

    - What frequency can we drive CLK at while initializing it? The LVI addendum says "host can start card communication in SDR12 mode from the start of initialization", but Physical Layer Simplified Specification says "During the card identification process, the card shall operate in the SD clock frequency of the identification clock rate fOD" (page 35), where fOD=[100,400] kHZ.

    - What's the difference between programming/erasing/writing?
        "As soon as the data transfer is completed, the card will exit the data write
        state and move either to the Programming State (transfer is successful) or
        Transfer State (transfer failed)."
        
        "The card may provide buffering for block write. This means that the next block
        can be sent to the card while the previous is being programmed."
        
        "If all write buffers are full, and as long as the card is in Programming State
        (see SD Memory Card state diagram Figure 4-13 ), the DAT0 line will be kept low (BUSY)."
