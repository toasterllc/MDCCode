Considerations

- Power-up sequence for Alliance SDRAM says CKE=L+DQM=H+NOPs, so add pull-down/pull-up resistors to CKE+DQM+CS_+RAS_+CAS_+WE_:
	"Power must be applied to VDD and VDDQ (simultaneously) when CKE="L", DQM="H" and all input signals are held "NOP" state"

- Make sure we have a 0-ohm resistors on the power supply inputs/outputs so we can remove them to perform current measurements.

- Add reverse-voltage protection using a FET, see ReverseCurrentBatteryProtectionCircuits.pdf

- We can improve battery life by using a buck regulator instead of an LDO. (LDOs constantly burn power proportional to the vin-vout difference, while bucks/switching supplies switch on/off.)
