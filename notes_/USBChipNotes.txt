    ST STM32F730I8 (https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f730r8.pdf)
        
        * Programmable via USB DFU mode 👍
        
        * Internal USB HS PHY 👍
        
        * Max HCLK (Power Scale 1, Overdrive OFF) = 180 MHz
        
        * Flexible Memory Controller (FMC) to interface with ice40
            - "The maximum FMC_CLK/FMC_SDCLK frequency for synchronous accesses is HCLK/2"
                - FMC_CLK = HCLK/2 = 180/2 = 90 MHz
                - "For 1.71 V≤VDD<1.9 V, maximum FMC_SDCLK = 70 MHz at CL=10 pF (on FMC_SDCLK)." -- Page 177
                    - Not sure which one is true -- 70 MHz or 90 MHz
        
        * QUADSPI memory interface to interface with ice40
            - Supports dual-flash, so we could have an 8-bit bus 👍
            - Writing isn't supported in memory-mapped mode 👎
            - Max freq:
                - 100 MHz when Vdd<2.7V (Page 180)
                    - 4-bit width -> 100*4 = 400 Mbps 👎
                    - 8-bit width -> 100*8 = 800 Mbps 👍
        
        * SDIO interface
            - Max freq = 50 MHz = 50*4 = 200 Mbps 👎
        
        * 176-pin BGA 👎
            - Smaller models don't have USB HS PHY / expose FMC to pins
        
        * Price
            $5.12/100 👍
    
    
    
    
    
    
    ST STM32H750VB (https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32h750ib.pdf)
        * Programmable via USB DFU mode 👍
        
        * Flexible Memory Controller (FMC) to interface with ice40
            - "The maximum FMC_CLK/FMC_SDCLK frequency for synchronous accesses is the FMC kernel clock divided by 2."
                - Max freq = 100 MHz, 8-bit width -> 800 Mbps 👍
        
        * QUADSPI memory interface to interface with ice40
            - Supports dual-flash, so we could have an 8-bit bus 👍
            
            - Max freq:
                - 100 MHz when Vdd>1.62V (Page 180)
                    - 4-bit width -> 100*4 = 400 Mbps 👎
                    - 8-bit width -> 100*8 = 800 Mbps 👍
                - 133 MHz when Vdd>2.7V
                    - 133*4 = 532 Mbps 👍
            
            - Can we effectively stream data with QUADSPI? Or does it need to take breaks while reading data?
                - SIOO mode might allow streaming data without breaks
            
            - Writing isn't supported in memory-mapped mode 👎
        
        * SDIO interface
            - Max freq = 125 MHz (62.5 MB/s)
        
        * Requires external USB-HS PHY 👎
        
        * Price

    ATSAMS70J19A-MN
        * Built-in USB-HS PHY 👍
        
        * Fast (300 MHz) 👍
        
        * External Bus Interface (EBI) to interface with ice40
            - Includes clock via SDRAM controller 👍
        
        * QSPI interface to interface with ice40
            - Fast enough?
        
        * "SAMV7x operates at 3.3V only."

    ATSAM3U1E
        * Built-in USB-HS PHY 👍
        
        * External Bus Interface (EBI) to interface with ice40
            - No clock 👎
        
        * HSMCI (8-bit)
            - Max freq: 65 MHz -> 65*8 == 520 Mbps 👍
                - "Pin Group 1 (1) Maximum output frequency" == 65 MHz @ VDDIO=3.0V
                    - May only be able to run at 45 MHz @ VDDIO=1.8V 👎
            
            - "The HSMCI operates at a rate of up to Master Clock divided by 2 and supports the interfacing of 1 slot(s)."
            - "High Speed MultiMedia Card Interface clock (MCCK or HSMCI_CK) is Master Clock (MCK) divided by (2*(CLKDIV+1))."
        
        * Max clock = 96 MHz, might limit throughput?

    ATSAM3U1C
        * Built-in USB-HS PHY 👍
        
        * External Bus Interface (EBI) to interface with ice40
            - No clock 👎
        
        * HSMCI (4-bit)
            - Max freq: 65 MHz -> 65*4 == 260 Mbps 👎
        
        * Max clock = 96 MHz, might limit throughput?
            - Likely limits throughput, since:
                - HSMCI is limited to 4-bit width
                - EBI doesn't support clock

    i.MX RT1060
        * Supports 1.8V I/Os even though VDD is 3.3V
    
    
    
    PIC32MZ
        * VDD > 2.1V 👎
            - VDD also supplies I/O pins, so we'd need level shifters 👎
