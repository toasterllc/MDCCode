    - Do we need to gate the enable of the oscillator until 1V8/2V8 are enabled? What does the image sensor require?
    
    - Move oscillator to bottom of board, so it can supply both ice40 and the image sensor
    
    - If we still have a pin header, add 1V8/GND signals to it
        - Add i2c lines too for image sensor
    
    - Add image sensor
    
    - Add SD card
    
    - Cascade PG from 2V8 into 1V8, so that the image sensor's 1V8 rail turns on after its 2V8 (per power-on sequencing steps in the AR0330CS datasheet)
    
    - Create programmer board using FT232H
        - Need mechanism to swap SO/SI lines to program flash vs. SRAM (see breakout board schematic)
            - Use a DPDT switch
        
        - Use level shifter with explicit inputs/outputs
            - Our bidirectional level shifter doesn't work for our use case (likely due to its bidirectional behavior and weak drive strength)
        
        X Need jumper to isolate CS_ line of flash / ice40 (see breakout board schematic)
            - Nevermind, we added a solder jumper to the board itself
    
    - Make VDD net larger?
    
    - TPS63805:
        - "Separate AGND and PGND. Do not connect AGND and PGND directly at the IC."
    
    - SDRAM: for proper power-up, we may need a pulldown on cs_ and pullups on ras_/cas_/we_, since power is supposed to be applied while the input signals are in the NOP state.
    
    - Upgrade capacitors where necessary, by derating them based on applied DC voltage
    
    - Clean up silkscreen component names
        - Make sure labels are large enough
    
    - Make sure we're tenting vias
    
    
    
    
    √ Replace 2V5 rail with 2V8 instead, which will work with both the image sensor and ICE40
    
    √ Switch flash to W25Q80EWUXIE, since its tVSL=10us, as required by the ice40
    
    √ ICE40: loading from flash isn't working
        √ Swap ICE_PRG_SO/ICE_PRG_SI pins entering flash chip. Currently we have the ICE40's SPI input connected to the flash's SPI input, and the ICE40's output connected to the flash's SPI output.
        √ Make sure the chosen flash meets the "SPI PROM Requirements" criteria in "iCE40 Programming and Configuration" document
            -> We'll meet these requirements by switching the flash chip to W25Q80EWUXIE
    
    √ TPS62801X_TPS6280X (U1/U2)
        √ Fix pinout. The 1V8 and 1V2 rails are currently broken because the pins of the TPS* chips are scrambled for some reason.
    
    √ Use new EagleLibrary as a submodule
    
    √ Rename MOLEX-734120110 -> UFL-CONNECTOR, make MFG/PN custom attributes on the schematic
    
    √ Figure out a way to represent multiple component part numbers for: L1/L2/L3, 1V2 rail chip, 1V8 rail chip
    
    √ Update MFG/PN for all components on schematic
    
    √ Update EagleLibrary's description of all MDC-imported components
    
    √ Check TP4 connection: was it connected in Rev1? Why isn't connected in the Rev2 board right now?
        - It used to be connected. I think we just deleted it somehow...
    
    
    
    
    
    









√ SDRAMController.v: figure out what to do with our Max(0, X-1) expressions, since they're now unsigned, since we switched up our functions return types...

√ SDRAMController.v: mark all registers `= 0`
√ SDRAMController.v: stop requiring an explicit reset signal, generate itself
√ SDRAMController.v: make work with W989D6DBGX6I, which adds another address bit







√ dev board schematic
    √ ice40: connect CDONE/CRESET
    √ ice40: connect SPI flash pins
    √ connect LEDs
    √ add ufl voltage test points
    √ add a header for the pix_ IOs, so we can provide data to the dev board to write
    √ update package sizes for all resistors, capacitors, and inductors
    √ choose resistor products/packages
    √ make sure inductor footprint allows any of our inductors to be soldered
    √ add 0ohm/1ohm resistors for testing/isolation
    √ consider removing some of the decoupling capacitors for ice40 power? the technote mentioned varying the 2 kinds of caps, so we can remove half...
    √ verify all packages+pins are correct and match datasheets


√ remove reset signal and see how that improves timing. need to decide whether we're going to use an explicit or implicit (configuration) reset
    definitely makes design smaller. we should use the implicit reset since it simplifies everything. the only caveat is we'll have to keep an eye out for Synplify's warning:
        removing sequential instance XXX because it does not drive other instances

√ make Lattice tool 'high effort' in the synthesis options
    no effect, design runs at the same speed

√ can we improve the empty/full logic of AFIFO to use readOK / writeOK logic instead? that way our registers will be initialized correctly with readOK=0 and writeOK=0


√ Iceboard_CopyImage: move pix_ IOs to the top-left instead of the top right, so they're closer to the RAM IOs. Does that improve speed?
    Doesn't help much
