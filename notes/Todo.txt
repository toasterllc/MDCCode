- For proper power-up, we may need a pulldown on cs_ and pullups on ras_/cas_/we_, since power is supposed to be applied while the input signals are in the NOP state.

- SDRAMController.v: stop requiring an explicit reset signal, generate itself
- SDRAMController.v: mark all registers `= 0`
- SDRAMController.v: figure out what to do with our Max(0, X-1) expressions, since they're now unsigned, since we switched up our functions return types...

√ SDRAMController.v: make work with W989D6DBGX6I, which adds another address bit







√ dev board schematic
    √ ice40: connect CDONE/CRESET
    √ ice40: connect SPI flash pins
    √ connect LEDs
    √ add ufl voltage test points
    √ add a header for the pix_ IOs, so we can provide data to the dev board to write
    √ update package sizes for all resistors, capacitors, and inductors
    √ choose resistor products/packages
    √ make sure inductor footprint allows any of our inductors to be soldered
    √ add 0ohm/1ohm resistors for testing/isolation
    √ consider removing some of the decoupling capacitors for ice40 power? the technote mentioned varying the 2 kinds of caps, so we can remove half...
    √ verify all packages+pins are correct and match datasheets


√ remove reset signal and see how that improves timing. need to decide whether we're going to use an explicit or implicit (configuration) reset
    definitely makes design smaller. we should use the implicit reset since it simplifies everything. the only caveat is we'll have to keep an eye out for Synplify's warning:
        removing sequential instance XXX because it does not drive other instances

√ make Lattice tool 'high effort' in the synthesis options
    no effect, design runs at the same speed

√ can we improve the empty/full logic of AFIFO to use readOK / writeOK logic instead? that way our registers will be initialized correctly with readOK=0 and writeOK=0


√ Iceboard_CopyImage: move pix_ IOs to the top-left instead of the top right, so they're closer to the RAM IOs. Does that improve speed?
    Doesn't help much
