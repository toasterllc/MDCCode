- Simulate IcestickTest_SDRAMReadWriteRandomly.v and verify that "at least a single-cycle delay should occur between the last read data and the WRITE command" 

- Test commit 1112b4686d changes via simulator that uses Micron model

- Test commit 1112b4686d changes on real device (random read/write test + UART test)

- See if there's a model for AS4C8M16MSA (low power SDRAM) and test commit 1112b4686d with that
