- Use CurrentRanger to find out how much current enters an unpowered STM32's GPIO,
  from a 47k resistor hooked to ~3.3V. Test on Rev3 board by removing an LED. (Or
  test first without removing an LED, in case the current is small enough in that
  case, and so we don't need to remove it.)

    - Did testing -- STM32 GPIO consumes 83 nA when the STM32 is unpowered
        -> GPIO resistance = 40 MÎ©
