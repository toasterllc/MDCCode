- Rev7 Software / Firmware Todo
    
    - ICEApp: update Pins.pcf (ICE40 pins changed on Rev7!)
    
    - MSPApp: can we save power by holding IMG in reset while writing to SD card?
    
    - MSPApp: Disable SD's DAT3 pullup by sending it the appropriate command, to help with signal integrity
        ACMD42 / SET_CLR_CARD_DETECT
    
    - MSPApp: while running on battery power with CurrentRanger monitoring, after some time the current
      consumption jumped from ~8µA to ~150µA, apparently not due to motion. Was this due to RTC timer
      waking us up? If so, why didn't we go back to sleep into LPM3.5?
    
    - MSPApp: store oldest 3 aborts, and newest 3 aborts (currently we only store the oldest 3 aborts)
    
    - MDCStudio: add inspector sidebar
    
    - MSPApp: Improve exposure/gain algs
    
    - MSPApp: Optimize battery usage
        - Measure current during with various rails enabled and make sure it's what we expect
        - Currently we keep VDD_B on all the time!
    
    - Make sure that IMG i2c lines are 0V while IMG power is off
        - On Rev4, ImgI2CMaster.v writes clkOut<=1 in its Idle state, so it's being driven when IMG is powered off
    
    - Patch icepack to specify frequency=high in bitstream
        - Doesn't look like there's a way to specify that in the command line options
    
    - Replace uses of RefCounted with just std::shared_ptr with a custom deleter?
      For example, there's no need to make syscalls to retain/release an io_service_t,
      when we can just use regular memory management right?
    
    - MDCStudio/STMApp: Implement battery voltage monitoring
    
    - ImagePipeline: improve perf so that we process each thumbnail in realtime to avoid slowing image loading more than the data transfer speed
        - Ie, make sure the bottleneck remains the data transfer
            - We transfer data at 42525582 bytes/sec -> /373760 == 113.778 thumbnails/sec -> 1/113.778 == 8.789 ms/thumbnail
            - Therefore ImagePipeline needs to process every image in less than 8.789ms
            - Currently ImagePipeline takes 9-12ms per thumbnail
        
        - ImagePipeline bottlenecks appear to be:
            - FFCC (takes 9.8 ms / thumbnail)
            - LMMSE (1.2 ms / thumbnail)
            - Remainder of ImagePipeline (2 ms / thumbnail)
            - Checksum validation (0.429687 ms / thumbnail)
    
    - ImagePipeline: FFCC:
        - Create new training set
            - Use color checker with known colors
                - We could either:
                    - Measure the colors ourself, or
                    - Use a colorchecker with guaranteed colors

            - Capture lots of different lighting conditions

            - Capture images with the color checker illuminated by the primary illuminant (ie not in a shadow)

            - Black-out color checker in images

            - Ensure there aren't common elements in each image (eg Sue holding the color checker)
    
    - ImagePipeline: Improve highlight reconstruction
        - In some cases HR makes some regions worse than if it didn’t kick in at all
        - Highlights in the sky can be particularly bad -- it replaces large regions with blocks of white. 
    
    - ImagePipeline: Re-calculate color correction matrices
        - Use real color checker
        - Use a spectrometer to measure color checker squares
        - Remember that our current CCMs are calculated by averaging the identity matrix with the calculated CCM
            - We did this because it improves the output (at least when using our laser-jet printout of the colorchecker)
    
        - We should have more than 2 CCMs, and interpolate between the 2 that are the closest match
          to a illuminant (as determined by the illuminant estimation algorithm)
    
    - ImagePipeline: Implement auto exposure / exposure correction in image pipeline
        - Determine the distribution of pixel brightness, and apply some function to spread out the
          brightness distribution across the entire range
        - See:
            https://twitter.com/CSProfKGD/status/1374463703345590272
            https://github.com/mahmoudnafifi/Exposure_Correction
    
    - ImagePipeline: Correct fixed-pattern noise
        http://www.moria.de/tech/image-sensors/preparation/
        - Saved as "ImageSensors-NoiseFiltering.webarchive"
        - If you set inttime=0, fixed pattern noise seems to be maximized
    
    - ImagePipeline: Implement dead pixel correction
    
    - MDCStudio: ImageGridView: thumbnail resize
        - Use LayerScrollView -magnifyIncrease: / -magnifyDecrease: interface
        - Add slider somewhere?
    
    - MDCStudio: ImageGridView: allow arrow keys to extend the current selection when holding shift/command
        - We need sophisticated handling similar to the Finder, but we should be able to do better
    
    - MDCStudio: image rotation
        - from grid view
        - from image view
    
    - MDCStudio: ImageGridView: allow enter key to open image
    
    - MDCStudio: ImageGridView: zoom animation when entering image view
    
    - MDCStudio: image exporting
    
    - MDCStudio: image drag/drop
        - to other apps
        - to existing library
        - to new library
    
    - MDCStudio: deleting images
        - show per-device trash can when images are deleted
    
    - MDCStudio: implement inspector
    
    - STMApp: occasionally aborts in _SDInit -> USBSendStatus() because the endpoint isn't ready
        - Haven't been able to determine cause yet
    
    - STMApp: reconsider whether we should be using Task::Stop() to abort tasks that are in progress.
      for example, a task might be in the middle of executing SDCard::Disable(), which isn't designed to be aborted half way through
    
    - MSPApp: make sure SysTick (WDT) doesn't wake us from LPM3.5
    
    - Test _State.img.ringBuf/_State.img.ringBuf2 resiliency to power loss
    
    - STMApp: enumeration failed in this scenario: MDC plugged in -> comp sleep -> comp wake -> "invalid endpoint 0x81"
    
    - Task.h: debug feature: stack traces
    
    - MSPApp: can we use the 'restart' facility of reset_register to speed up integration time changes?
        - 'restart' triggers a bad frame, so experiment with the 'restart_bad' and 'mask_bad' flags too
    
    - Fix bug: Without STLink connected, sometimes STApp crashes when plugging in
        - One cause is because Img::Sensor::Init() failed, because of an IMG I2C error
            - Might be because we're not waiting long enough after turning on the power rails to do I2C comms
                - "#warning TODO: measure how long it takes for IMG rails to rise"
