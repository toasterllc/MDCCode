    √ Test whether we can get LVS identification working
        - It works!
        - See SDLVSTest-Scheme5
        - Need to implement in SDController.v
    
    √ We may need to speed up pix_dclk to get some more headroom to comfortable hit 108MHz
        √ Optimizing highlight/shadow counting appears to help significantly. Options:
            √ 1. Add pipelining, particularly the `fifoIn_write_trigger && !fifoIn_x && !fifoIn_y` boolean chain. Store that boolean in a register to be read on the next clock cycle
            2. Move highlight/shadow counting out of PixController and into a separate command issued to ICE40, specifically for calculating stats on the image stored in RAM
    
    X If we end up removing SD card pullups in favor of ice40 internal ones:
        - Make sure these pullups are enabled on the SB_IO instantiation
            - Nevermind, we kept the pullups

    - MSP430: If we need more FRAM/SRAM, replace MSP430FR2422 (8KB FRAM, 2KB SRAM) -> MSP430FR2433 (16KB FRAM, 4KB SRAM)
    
    - MSP430: fix power supply when plugged into USB
        - Problem: MSP430 needs a voltage higher than 2V to reliably start up, due to SVS
        √ Solution: Replace MAX40203 with TPS706 LDO
            - LDO requirements
                - LDO input = VDD_B
                - LDO output = 2.5V - 3.3V (use >2.4V so the motion sensor is powered)
                - Needs enable, controlled by VDD_SRC_USB
                - Needs to allow output voltage to be high while LDO is off (in battery mode)
                - Needs reverse current protection (in case battery voltage is higher)
                - Can't have an output discharge circuit (otherwise it'll draw current when disabled, in battery mode)
            
            - Still need to use level shifter for MSP's TEST/RST_ nets, since MSP's Vih is
              still too high (.75*2.5=1.875, which is too high to be driven by STM running at 1.8V)
            
            - Part options:
                TPS706
                    Input voltage: 2.7-6.5 V
                    Output voltage: 1.2-5 V
                    Enable voltage: 0-6.5 V
                    Reverse current (current flowing into OUT pin @ VOUT=3V, VIN=VEN=0V): 100nA
        
        - Solution: Make VDD_A=VDD_2V8
            X This won't work in battery mode because the MAX40203's voltage input needs to be lower than the battery voltage, otherwise we'll charge the battery
            - But how do we handle STM comms since STM runs at 1.8V?
                - We can't connect directly to STM because MSP430 Vih=2.1 (>1.9V of STM) 👎
                - Use level shifter. We'll need to free up a spot though
            - Confirm with simulation that the power topology still works (no reverse voltage into battery, etc)
        
        - Solution: Make power supply start at >2.1V, then settle at 1.9V
            - How do we do that?
                - Might not be possible with TPS62802 since its output levels are digitally selected, not analog
                    - We would need a variable resistence on TPS62802 MODE pin
                        - Complicated
                - Some kind of crazy charge pump circuit that's only active at power on?
    
    - MSP430: fix level shifting
        - Since MSP430 is now running at 2.5V, we need to level-shift ICE_MSP_SPI_CLK/ICE_MSP_SPI_DATA and MSP_TEST/MSP_RST_
        
        - Solution: 2x NXB0102/NTB0102 level shifters
            - Pros
                - Simple
                - Small package (2.1*2 == 4.2 mm^2)
                - 1 STM pin for MSP_RST
                - 1 ICE pin for DOUT/DIN
            - Cons
                - Medium-ish leakage current (1uA @ 25C)
        
        - Solution: NTZD3155C NFET/PFETs (see schematics in notebook)
            - Pros
                - Low leakage
                    - Most datasheets are very conservative
                    - See https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/98597/low-drain-source-mosfet-leakage
                    - NTND31015NZTAG -- IDSS=100pA @ 25C
                    - XLLGA6 -- IDSS=100pA @ 25C
            - Cons
                - 2 STM pins for MSP_RST_
                - 2 ICE pins for DOUT/DIN
                - Large package (2.56*4 == 10.24 mm^2)
                - Need 4x + 3 resistors
        
        X Solution: 74AUP1T34
            X No direction pin
            - Pros
                - Low leakage (.2uA)
            - Cons
                - Max voltage is 3.6V
        
        X Solution: use 2x SN74LVC2T45
            X Only has 1 direction pin
            - Medium-ish leakage current (1uA @ 25C)
            - One for ICE_MSP_SPI_CLK / ICE_MSP_SPI_DATA (direction controlled by MSP430)
            - One for MSP_TEST / MSP_RST_ (direction controlled by STM32)
    
    - Fix MSP level shifter net names:
        - ICE_MSP_SPI_CLK is actually ICE_MSP_SPI_DATA
        - ICE_MSP_SPI_DATA is actually ICE_MSP_SPI_CLK
    
    √ Find solution for ICE40's VOH(min)=[1.5,1.7] < SD's VIH(min)=1.75
        √ Solution: only use LVS ('A2') SD cards, and implement LVS identification protocol
            √ Need to figure out how LVS identification works
                - Working
                    - See SDLVSTest-Scheme5
            - Pros:
                - Simple
                - Keep existing SD infrastructure
            - Cons:
                - LVS SD cards ('A2') aren't as readily available
                - LVS SD cards are more expensive
            
            - LVS cards:

        - Solution: switch to eMMC
            - For example: https://lcsc.com/product-detail/FLASH_TOSHIBA-THGBMJG6C1LBAIL_C524518.html
            - Pros:
                - No voltage switching required
            - Cons:
                - Aren't easily sourced
                - More expensive
        
        - Solution: implement voltage switching
            - We could use 2 PFETs to switch between voltages, but we'd want break-before-make
              logic, so we'd need to engineer a solution that prevents the voltage from dipping
              below 1.8V when switching the supplies.
            
            - Pros:
                - Proper solution per the SD spec
            - Cons:
                - Complicated
                    - Would require 1 or 2 more IOs to control the PFETs (either from ICE40 or MSP430)
                - Not sure if ICE40 allows VCCIO to change dynamically
        
        - Solution: do nothing and test whether ICE40's VOH is actually a problem in practice










- Future
    
    - Add a zener diode to VDD_BAT_IN to protect from over-voltage
        - Zeners have significant leakage though. Use a mosfet instead?
    
    ? Add a zener diode to VDD_USB_IN to protect from over-voltage
    
    - Consider using a HyperRAM instead of SDRAM
        - Pros:
            - Fewer pins: only 24 pins instead of 54 SDRAM pins
            - Doesn't need explicit refreshes, which simplifies RAMController Verilog
            - Appears to have lower power consumption
                - HyperRAM W956D8MBYA: 25 mA @ 200 MHz, VCC=2.0V
                - AS4C8M16MSA SDRAM: 75 mA @ ? MHz, VCC=1.8V
                - W989D6DBGX6I: 75 mA @ ? MHz, VCC=1.8V
        
        - Cons:
            - Requires DDR signals to operate
            - Unsure if ICE40 DDR outputs can operate fast enough
                - Image sensor output = 12 bits @ 98 MHz == 1.176e9 bits/sec
                - Clock setups:
                    - Scheme50: HyperRAM clock @ 50 MHz -> 50e6 * 8 (bits per transfer) * 2 (transfers per clock) == .8e9 bits/sec (🚫 not fast enough)
                        - DDR signals switch at 2x -> 100 MHz
                    - Scheme75: HyperRAM clock @ 75 MHz -> 75e6 * 8 (bits per transfer) * 2 (transfers per clock) == 1.2e9 bits/sec (👍 fast enough)
                        - DDR signals switch at 2x -> 150 MHz (😬 not sure if ICE40 DDR outputs can switch this fast)
                            - See "Maximum sysIO Buffer Performance" below
                    - Scheme90: HyperRAM clock @ 90 MHz -> 90e6 * 8 (bits per transfer) * 2 (transfers per clock) == 1.44e9 bits/sec (👍 fast enough)
                        - DDR signals switch at 2x -> 180 MHz (😬 not sure if ICE40 DDR outputs can switch this fast)
                            - See "Maximum sysIO Buffer Performance" below
                - Even if we can squeak by with Scheme75/Scheme90 with 12-bit pixels, we probably couldn't with 14-bit pixels (which we might want to some day)
                - From the "iCE40 LP/HX Family Data Sheet":
                    - Maximum sysIO Buffer Performance:
                        - LVCMOS18: 155 MHz
                            - Therefore, don't feel confident that we can DDR outputs at more than 155 MHz
    
    - Figure out battery power supply
        - How many batteries?
        - What battery voltage range? .8-1.7V per battery?
        - Optimize efficiency
        - Use Webench to optimize efficiency, if it supports the power ICs that we choose
            - Note that Webench doesn't support all available TI ICs, eg TPS61200
    
    - Length match traces going to RAM
    
    - Length match traces going to image sensor
    
    - Add MOSFET power transistors to define power domains
    
    - An eMMC (such as iNAND 7250, see datasheet in notes dir) might consume less power / be more reliable than an SD card. We can likely write to them faster (and maybe initialize them faster), so even if their current usage is higher, they may end up using less energy for the same operation if we can get the operation completed faster than with an SD card.
    
    - SDRAM: for proper power-up, we may need a pulldown on cs_ and pullups on ras_/cas_/we_, since power is supposed to be applied while the input signals are in the NOP state.
    
    - Add USB inrush protection
    
    - Add system-level ESD protection
        From MSP430 datasheet:
            System-level ESD protection must be applied in compliance with the device-level ESD specification
            to prevent electrical overstress or disturbing of data or code memory. See MSP430 System-Level

    - Improve current sense resistor
        - Use low-tempco resistor
        - Change value to .2Ω or .1Ω (depending on current range)




- Image pipeline todo

    - Speed up pipeline, especially Defringe and FFCC (illuminant estimation) stages
        - Currently the whole pipeline can take ~200ms
    
    - Train FFCC (illuminant estimation) with more data and better data
    
    - Improve highlight reconstruction
        - In some cases HR makes some regions worse than if it didn’t kick in at all
        - Highlights in the sky can be particularly bad -- it replaces large regions with blocks of white. 
    
    - Re-calculate color correction matrices
        - Use real color checker
        - Use a spectrometer to measure color checker squares
        - Remember that our current CCMs are calculated by averaging the identity matrix with the calculated CCM
            - We did this because it improves the output (at least when using our laser-jet printout of the colorchecker)
        
        - We should have more than 2 CCMs, and interpolate between the 2 that are the closest match
          to a illuminant (as determined by the illuminant estimation algorithm)
    
    - Implement auto exposure / exposure correction in image pipeline
        - Determine the distribution of pixel brightness, and apply some function to spread out the
          brightness distribution across the entire range
        - See:
            https://twitter.com/CSProfKGD/status/1374463703345590272

    - Correct fixed-pattern noise
        http://www.moria.de/tech/image-sensors/preparation/
        - Saved as "ImageSensors-NoiseFiltering.webarchive"
        - If you set inttime=0, fixed pattern noise seems to be maximized
    
    - Implement dead pixel correction
    
    √ Implement more sophisticated white balance for Defringe filter
        - To operate correctly, the raw data input into the Defringe filter needs to be white-balanced.
        - Currently, we're just white balancing using hard-coded constants, but that probably doesn't
          work well with all illuminants.
    
    √ Implement auto white balance (AWB)
        - Apply as very first stage (before defringing and debayering)
            - Defringe needs white-balanced image, so it makes sense to apply WB before defringing
