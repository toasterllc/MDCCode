    - Bodge VDD_A to 2V8 so that MSP430 is powered properly
    
    - Fix MSP_RST_/MSP_TEST logic levels
        *** Before bodging, just try programming MSP first. It's possible that 1.8V will meet MSP's Vih ***
        - Option: Sever the MSP_RST_/MSP_TEST connections to MSP, wire them to MSPLevelShifter, then wire the output back to the MSP_RST_/MSP_TEST pins?
        - Option: Bodge STM_LED0/STM_LED1 -> MSPLevelShifter -> MSP_RST_/MSP_TEST
    
    - Swap motion sensor VDD/GND pins when soldering
    
    - Update STM32/ICE40 to use 16 MHz clock, instead of 24 MHz
    
    - Verilog: Update SDRAM controller for new part (Winbond -> Alliance)
    
    - Verilog: Rename PIX -> IMG
    
    √ Test whether we can get LVS identification working
        - It works!
        - See SDLVSTest-Scheme5
        - Need to implement in SDController.v
    
    √ We may need to speed up pix_dclk to get some more headroom to comfortably hit 108MHz
        √ Optimizing highlight/shadow counting appears to help significantly. Options:
            √ 1. Add pipelining, particularly the `fifoIn_write_trigger && !fifoIn_x && !fifoIn_y` boolean chain. Store that boolean in a register to be read on the next clock cycle
            2. Move highlight/shadow counting out of PixController and into a separate command issued to ICE40, specifically for calculating stats on the image stored in RAM
    
    X If we end up removing SD card pullups in favor of ice40 internal ones:
        - Make sure these pullups are enabled on the SB_IO instantiation
            - Nevermind, we kept the pullups


- Rev4 Board Test Checklist
    - Verify that the clock-blocking buffer blocks the clock to IMG when VDD_1V9_IMG=0
    
    - Verify that when battery powered:
        VDD_A = VDD_BAT
        VDD_B = HiZ / VDD_BAT (controlled by MSP)
    
    - Verify that when USB powered:
        VDD_A = 1.9V
        VDD_B = VDD_USB - V_diode_forward ~= 4.5V
