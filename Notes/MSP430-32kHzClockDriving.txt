MSP430 32 kHz Clock

Using a crystal directly is very low power, so there's no reason to use an SiTime component...

    "The MSP430 MCU LFXT1 32-kHz crystal oscillator is designed for ultra-low-power consumption.
    According to the data sheets, most MSP430 MCU derivatives consume less than 1 μA when the
    32-kHz oscillator, the clock signal (ACLK), and a timer are running."

    From MSP430FR2422 datasheet:
        – Standby: LPM3.5, real-time clock (RTC)
            counter with 32768-Hz crystal: 710 nA (typical)

    Requires external capacitors at both terminals to meet the effective load capacitance
    specified by crystal manufacturers. Recommended effective load capacitance values
    supported are 3.7 pF, 6 pF, 9 pF, and 12.5 pF. Maximum shunt capacitance of 1.6 pF.
    The PCB adds additional capacitance, so it must also be considered in the overall
    capacitance. Verify that the recommended effective load capacitance of the selected crystal is met.

LFXTBYPASS

It is also possible to apply digital clock signals to the XIN input pin that meet the specifications of the respective oscillator if the appropriate XT1BYPASS mode is selected. In this case, the associated XOUT pin can be used for other purposes. If the XIN and XOUT pins are not used, they must be terminated according to Section 7.6.
