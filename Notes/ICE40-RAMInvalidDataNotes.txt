ICE40 RAM Invalid Data Notes

The ICE40 4K-bit RAMs output invalid data until a certain number of clock cycles have
been received on the configuration SPI clock (SPI_SCK), immediately after the
bitstream data has been received.

After CDONE transitions from 0->1, 49 SPI_SCK cycles are required per "iCE40
Programming and Configuration". Empirically the following behavior is observed:

    0 SPI_SCK cycles
    <- DesignRunning=0, RAMWorking=0
    8 SPI_SCK cycles
    <- DesignRunning=0, RAMWorking=0
    8 SPI_SCK cycles
    <- DesignRunning=1, RAMWorking=0
    8 SPI_SCK cycles
    <- DesignRunning=1, RAMWorking=0
    8 SPI_SCK cycles
    <- DesignRunning=1, RAMWorking=1
    ... Remaining SPI_SCK cycles ...

As the above sequence shows, there's a period where the design is running but the
RAMs aren't working. This period can last an arbitrary amount of time and is
determined solely by the number of received SPI_SCK cycles.
