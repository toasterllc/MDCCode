# SD Card Test Log

This data was collected by continuously writing the same image (in SDRAM) to ascending addresses on the SD card.

See scope shots in ScopeShots-1 and ScopeShots-2 directories. The difference between ScopeShots-1 and
ScopeShots-2 is merely that ScopeShots-2 contains the average current consumption (instead of the
frequency, which we don't care about.).




* PNY Elite-X 64 GB
    √ LVS init works
    X CMD6 fails (after LVS init) when trying to switch to SDR104
        - CMD6 works fine when doing 3.3V init
        - Haven't been able to root cause
        - For now we simply can't get to SDR104 when doing LVS init, so are options are either:
            - Use legacy 3.3V init, or
            - Don't support this card

        Max: 220 mA
