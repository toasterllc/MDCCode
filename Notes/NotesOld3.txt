    √ Implement thumbnailing in ICEAppMSP / MSPApp
        - Motivation: so MDCStudio can load thumbnails quickly
    
    √ Cancel order for TPS62802YKAR / TPS63805YFFR if we no longer need it
    
    √ Return TPS62802 package to Mouser
        - Mailed on 9/12
            - Tracking number: 92001901755477300057037178

    X "The drive settings of XT1 can be increased with the XT1DRIVE bits. At power up, the XT1 starts with the
      highest drive settings for fast reliable startup. After startup, user software can reduce the drive strength to
      reduce power consumption."
          X Tried implementing this but the current saved isn't that much, and there's no clean way to implement it. See XT1DRIVE comments in RTC.h.
    
    √ MSPApp: are the rails properly reset to their default values when we abort?
    
    √ MSPApp: before turning on the AC to cool the room, MDC current was increasing and eventually hit ~20µA.
        - This may have been due to floating inputs! Make sure we have a pulldown on everything.
    
    √ MSPApp: power: try putting all GPIOs in high-impedance with pulldown, and turn chip off. what is the current consumption?
        - 2.8 µA
    
    √ MDCStudio/MSPApp: implement time handling
        - MDCStudio needs to set MSP's time
    
    √ MSPApp: Implement VDD_B rail handling.
        - Turn on lazily when we need to talk to ICE / IMG / SD?
    
    √ Bug: discrepency between wall time and device time on images
        - Problem: _Clock::Init() prevents MSP430 from consuming time sent by host before the host
          stops MSP430 again via _MSPConnectAndUnlockPins() when trying to talk to the SD card
    
    √ Investigate: _Clock::Init() takes 173 ms
        - Is that due to our bodge wire?
            X Not due to bodge wire; Rev4 takes 205ms!
        - Can we speed it up? Is it necessary to do when exiting LPM3.5? The clock should already be running since it sources RTC...
        - We don't need MSP430's clock to be driven by the 32khz crystal right? Only RTC? Can we use that fact to speed it up?
        √ Fixed by using calibrated value for CSCTL0, which speeds up FLL lock; it takes 800us now.
    
    √ Make sure all capacitors / resistors have part numbers
    
    √ Order stencils
    
    √ Order parts
    
    √ Re-synthesize with new ICE40 pin locations to make sure everything works
    
    √ When complete, make sure board origin is at 0,0
    
    √ Make board left/right borders smaller
    
    √ Layout!
    
    √ Make sure y position of motion sensor and image sensor are equal
    
    √ Verify lengths of IMG_ and SD_ nets
    
    √ Buy more TPS62802 if needed
        - Supposed to be delivered 10/2022
    
    √ Length-match IMG wires
    
    √ Length-match SD wires
    
    √ Correct (swap) ICE SPI flash's data in/out pins so that by default, the flash is ready to
      be read by ICE40, but STM32 can program it by bit-banging ICE_ST_SPI_D0 / ICE_ST_SPI_D1
    
    X Connect ICE40 VPP_2V5 to 3V3 instead of 2V8 if it helps us, since we're no longer
      going to be doing NVCM Programming we're not limited by the 3V max voltage anymore
      
      X Nevermind, this would require an additional load switch, since VDD_A_3V3 is our
        3V3 rail, and it's part of the VDD_A power domain, which is always on, so it
        can't be connected to VPP_2V5 without gating it on VDD_B.
    
    √ USB C jack: figure out what to do with: CC1/CC2/SBU1/SBU2
        - CC1/CC2: 5.1k pulldowns
        - SBU1/SBU2: unconnected
    
    √ Verify that slots for USB-C jack footprint are recognized by OSH-Park
    
    √ Switch USB receptacle to USB-C
    
    √ Add battery terminal
    
    √ Consider moving ICE_MSP_SPI_DATA to K3
        - On Rev4, ICE_MSP_SPI_DATA is assigned to K1, which is a PIO pair with J1,
          forcing them to share the same clock. J1 is ram_dq[15], which uses `ram_clk`,
          which clearly can't be used for ICE_MSP_SPI_DATA.
          
        - We can move ICE_MSP_SPI_DATA to K3 if we don't need ICE_MSP_SPI_AUX
            - K3 doesn't share a PIO with anything -- it's independent
    
    √ Move ICE_MSP_SPI_CLK to K2 to be closer to ICE_MSP_SPI_DATA, also free up K1
      (which is high-value since it's on the edge)
    
    √ Create new connection:
        - Name:     ICE_ST_SPI_D_READY
        - Between:  ICE40.L5 <-> STM32.R3
        - Purpose:  Signals that SD data is ready to be read from ICE40
    
    √ Connect to STM32: BAT_CHRG_STAT, BAT_CHRG_LVL, BAT_CHRG_LVL_EN_
        - So STM32 can monitor charging status
    
    √ Add ESD protection diode to MOSFET gate
    
    √ Add bypass caps to all new components
        √ Flash: W25Q40EWUXIE
        √ Battery charger: MCP73831
        √ Power mux: TPS2116
        √ LDO: AP7350-33CF4-7
        √ Level shifters: NXP-NTB0102
    
    X Measure inrush current to see if it's in-spec since we're using multiple 10uF capacitors on VDD_USB
        X Nevermind, after reading the following, 10uF limit makes sense:
            https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/36375/understanding-usb-inrush-current-requirements
        
        - We have several 10u capacitors on VDD_USB, which is more than the USB spec allows (max 10uF),
          but that's OK if the inrush current isn't exceeded
    
    √ Add reverse current protection for VDD_A_3V3 LDO
        - Consider case: input power is instantly disconnected, so Vout>Vin. Do we need to protect LDO from reverse current?
            - From TPS7A02 datasheet: "This reverse current flow can cause damage to the device."
    
    √ Add flash for ICE40 (instead of using NVCM)
        - W25Q40EWUXIE looks good (DigiKey)
    
    √ Add LDO to provide VDD_A_3V3
        - AP7350-33CF4-7 looks like a good option
            - Vout = 3.3V
            - Iout,max = 150mA
            - Iq = .25µA
    
    √ Add LIPO charger circuit
        √ MCP73831
        - DIO5518B
        - DIO5508CD10
    
    √ Add reverse polarity protection in case the battery is inserted backwards:
        https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/application-notes/an-171_an-1568.pdf
        Use PMOS design
    
    √ Add TPS2116 power mux to switch between USB power and battery power
    
    √ Replace TPS63805 power supply with TPS62802, outputting 2.8V
    
    √ Remove ICE_MSP_SPI_DATA_DIR now that we have the direction-sensing level shifters
    
    √ For VDD_A, is it more efficient to use an LDO or a buck (TPS62802)?
        - LDO!
            - LDO wastes: Pwaste = (Vin-Vout)*Iout + Vin*Iq
                - Vin=4.2, Vout=3.6, Iout=5µA, Iq=.5uA: (4.2-3.6)*(5µA) + 4.2*(.5µA) = 5.1µW
                - Vin=3.7, Vout=3.6, Iout=5µA, Iq=.5uA: (3.7-3.6)*(5µA) + 3.7*(.5µA) = 2.35µW
                - Vin=3.7, Vout=3.3, Iout=5µA, Iq=.5uA: (3.7-3.3)*(5µA) + 3.3*(.5µA) = 3.65µW
            - Buck wastes: Pwaste = Vout*Iout*((1/Eff)-1) =
                - Vout=4.2, Iout=5µA, Eff=.2: 4.2*(5µA)*((1/.2)-1) = 0.000084 = 84µW
                - Vout=3.6, Iout=5µA, Eff=.2: 3.6*(5µA)*((1/.2)-1) = 0.000072 = 72µW
    
    √ Fix motion sensor layout (we swapped the VDD and GND pins)
    
    √ Consolidate parts
        √ 249k resistor? (replace with 422k, since it just needs to be >= 249k)
        √ 4.7uF capacitor (2-3x 2.2uF)
        X 3k resistor (?)
            X We're not using 1k resistors
        X 91k resistor
            X We can't afford to let the 2V8 rail stray from its current value
        X 422k resistor
            X We can't afford to let the 2V8 rail stray from its current value
    
    √ Replace 0-ohm resistors with solder jumpers
    
    √ Switch 1V9 back to 1V8, now that we've solved the SD card Vih by using LVS
    
    √ Switch crystal to use Q13FC13500005 (ordered 110x from LCSC)
        √ Also update 2x crystal capacitors -- see CrystalLoadCapacitanceCalculations.txt
        - See CrystalPartOptions.txt for other parts
    
    √ Fix power system to ensure that reverse current into battery/USB isn't possible
        - Things to test:
            - Ramp up USB (BAT) while BAT (USB) is already supplying power
                - Reverse current?
            - Plug in USB (BAT) while BAT (USB) is already supplying power, where USB (BAT) < BAT (USB)
                - Reverse current?
            - Plug in USB (BAT) while BAT (USB) is already supplying power, where USB (BAT) > BAT (USB)
                - Reverse current?
            - Disconnect USB (BAT) while USB (BAT) is supplying power
                - In other words, disconnect the power source that is supply power
                - Reverse current?
            - Disconnect USB (BAT) while BAT (USB) is supplying power
                - In other words, disconnect the power source that isn't supply power
                - Reverse current?
    
    √ Use Nexperia 74LVC1G98GW,125 logic gate for:
        √ IMG clock-blocking buffer (replace TI part)
        √ VDD_B_EN OR gate (inputs: VDD_B_EN from MSP, VDD_USB)
    
    √ MSP430: fix power supply, again
        √ Switched to a slow-on/fast-off break-before-make power rail solution
    
    √ MSP430: fix power supply when plugged into USB
        - Problem: MSP430 needs a voltage higher than 2V to reliably start up, due to SVS
        √ Solution: Replace MAX40203 with TPS706 LDO
            - LDO requirements
                - LDO input = VDD_B
                - LDO output = 2.5V - 3.3V (use >2.4V so the motion sensor is powered)
                - Needs enable, controlled by VDD_USB
                - Needs to allow output voltage to be high while LDO is off (in battery mode)
                - Needs reverse current protection (in case battery voltage is higher)
                - Can't have an output discharge circuit (otherwise it'll draw current when disabled, in battery mode)
            
            - Still need to use level shifter for MSP's TEST/RST_ nets, since MSP's Vih is
              still too high (.75*2.5=1.875, which is too high to be driven by STM running at 1.8V)
            
            - LDO options:
                TPS706
                    Input voltage: 2.7-6.5 V
                    Output voltage: 1.2-5 V
                    Enable voltage: 0-6.5 V
                    Reverse current (current flowing into OUT pin @ VOUT=3V, VIN=VEN=0V): 100nA
        
        - Solution: Make VDD_A=VDD_2V8, via MAX40203
            X This won't work in battery mode because the MAX40203's voltage input needs to be lower than the battery voltage, otherwise we'll charge the battery
            - But how do we handle STM comms since STM runs at 1.8V?
                - We can't connect directly to STM because MSP430 Vih=2.1 (>1.9V of STM) 👎
                - Use level shifter. We'll need to free up a spot though
            - Confirm with simulation that the power topology still works (no reverse voltage into battery, etc)
        
        - Solution: Make power supply start at >2.1V, then settle at 1.9V
            - How do we do that?
                - Might not be possible with TPS62802 since its output levels are digitally selected, not analog
                    - We would need a variable resistence on TPS62802 MODE pin
                        - Complicated
                - Some kind of crazy charge pump circuit that's only active at power on?
    
    √ MSP430: fix level shifting
        - Since MSP430 is now running at 2.5V, we need to level-shift ICE_MSP_SPI_CLK/ICE_MSP_SPI_DATA and MSP_TEST/MSP_RST_
        
        - Bench-testing supply current of NTB0102
            - Supply current <5nA when A1=A2=VDDA=2.5V and B1=B2=VDDB=0V
                - Same ballpark as reported in "Typical supply current" section of the datasheet 
        
        √ Solution: 2x Nexperia NXB0102/NTB0102 level shifters
            - TI TXB0102 / TXB0302 would also work
                - They don't publish 'supply current' though; power consumption might be higher
            
            - Need to adjust MSP_RST_ pin:
                - Remove pullup (rely on internal ~31k pullup)
                    - Reason: Internal pullup is already on the low side, and the external one will act in parallel, reducing overall resistance further
                    - Reason: "Any pull-up or pull-down resistors used must be kept higher than 50 kΩ"
                - Reduce capacitor to <70pF (reuse cap used elsewhere in design whatever other capacitor)
                    - Reason: "NXB0102 [can] drive capacitive loads of up to 70 pF"
            
            - MSP_RST_ Calculations
                - Because MSP430 has internal pullup (measured: 31k, datasheet: 20k-50k) that's on the low side,
                  the level shifter's VOL and MSP's VIL need to be compared.
                    - Worst case:
                        - NXB0102 output driver = 6k
                            - 6k=4k*1.5 -- assumed worst-case value; TI level shifters assume 4.5k as worst-case, so 6k is conservative
                        - MSP430 RST pullup = 20k (from datasheet)
                        - NXB0102 VOL = (6k/(20k+6k)) * 2.5V == 0.577
                        - MSP430 VIL = 0.625 (.25*2.5, from datasheet)
                        √ VOL=0.577 < VIL=0.625
                            - Therefore in the worst-case, NXB0102's VOL will still trigger a low value for MSP

    √ Fix MSP level shifter net names:
        - ICE_MSP_SPI_CLK is actually ICE_MSP_SPI_DATA
        - ICE_MSP_SPI_DATA is actually ICE_MSP_SPI_CLK
    
    √ Find solution for ICE40's VOH(min)=[1.5,1.7] < SD's VIH(min)=1.75
        √ Solution: only use LVS ('A2') SD cards, and implement LVS identification protocol
            √ Need to figure out how LVS identification works
                - Working
                    - See SDLVSTest-Scheme5
            - Pros:
                - Simple
                - Keep existing SD infrastructure
            - Cons:
                - LVS SD cards ('A2') aren't as readily available
                - LVS SD cards are more expensive
            
            - LVS cards:

                https://www.neweggbusiness.com/product/product.aspx?item=9b-20-175-006&tpk=9b-20-175-006
        
        - Solution: switch to eMMC
            - For example: https://lcsc.com/product-detail/FLASH_TOSHIBA-THGBMJG6C1LBAIL_C524518.html
            - Pros:
                - No voltage switching required
            - Cons:
                - Aren't easily sourced
                - More expensive
        
        - Solution: implement voltage switching
            - We could use 2 PFETs to switch between voltages, but we'd want break-before-make
              logic, so we'd need to engineer a solution that prevents the voltage from dipping
              below 1.8V when switching the supplies.
            
            - Pros:
                - Proper solution per the SD spec
            - Cons:
                - Complicated
                    - Would require 1 or 2 more IOs to control the PFETs (either from ICE40 or MSP430)
                - Not sure if ICE40 allows VCCIO to change dynamically
        
        - Solution: do nothing and test whether ICE40's VOH is actually a problem in practice





- Rev4 Todo
    
    √ MDCStudio: implement image view
        √ cache: responsible for returning image if already loaded, and fetching it if not
        √ image provider: responsible for loading images from SD card or disk
        √ cache or image provider needs to handle dropping work
        √ when neighbor loading, new neighbor loading works should occur before existing neighbor loading, and a neighbor loading that happens later shouldn't cause an earlier cache entry to be evicted
        √ cache or image provider should queue work, and drop the work that's no longer needed
            √ eg: when user quickly flips through full-size images, lots of work would be enqueued, but we may not need the work at the end
                √ Priority: required, high, low
        √ allow arrow keys to be used to navigate to the previous/next image
            X use animation
                X animation is too distracting
        √ implement zooming
        √ implement panning
        √ optimize draw performance by caching full-size image texture
        √ draw shadow behind image
        √ 'size-to-fit' mode; stay in this mode until zooming manually
        √ keyboard zooming (cmd+, cmd-)
        √ mouse zooming (command-scroll)
        √ implement:
            - (NSRect)rectForSmartMagnificationAtPoint:(NSPoint)location inRect:(NSRect)visibleRect API_AVAILABLE(macos(10.8));
        √ latch pan/zoom mode when -scrollWheel: starts, so we can't flip between scrolling and zooming
    
    √ MDCStudio: use LayerScrollView / MetalScrollLayer for ImageGridView
    
    √ MDCStudio: merge ImageGridLayer into ImageGridView, the same as we did for ImageView
    
    √ MDCStudio: create ImageSource that wraps ImageCache+ImageLibrary, and pass that around
    
    √ MDCStudio: implement grid view selection
        √ Arrow key selection modification
            √ Scroll view focus should follow selection
        √ Select-all
        √ Shift/command selection to add/remove selected items
        √ Drag-select should autoscroll the scroll view
    
    √ MDCStudio: switch to delegate model:
        √ SourceListView
        √ ImageGridView
        X ResizerView
    
    √ MDCStudio: prevent selection layer from being clipped
    
    √ MDCStudio: make device names editable
    
    √ MDCStudio: make document based
    
    √ MDCStudio: implement device list sidebar
    
    √ MDCStudio: draw line between source list and content view
    
    √ MDCStudio: ImageLibrary.h: add ability to observe changes, so that we can update the grid
    
    √ MDCStudio: corrupt images appear after: initial load ; exit MDCStudio ; icewrite ; mspreadstate ; take more photos ; relaunch MDCStudio
    
    √ STMApp: ICEWrite fails on the second invocation
    
    √ MDCStudio: fix artifacts when resizing window
    
    √ MDCStudio: first draw of grid layer is weird
    
    X MDCStudio: MDCDevice.h: make sure we sync _imgLib _before_ writing imgIdEnd, to guarantee _imgLib.back.id >= imgIdEnd,
      so if we crash between writing the IL and writing imgIdEnd, we can recover if we see that imgIdEnd < _imgLib.back.id
        √ We ended up closely coupling ImageLibrary with RecordStore -- they now both write their state to the same file
    
    X MDCStudio: MDCDevice.h: if imgIdEnd < _imgLib.back.id, update imgIdEnd = _imgLib.back.id
        √ We shouldn't need to worry about this anymore now that ImageLibrary and RecordStore are closely coupled
    
    X MDCStudio: figure out a locking scheme so that MDCDevice.h and ImageLibrary.h share a lock
        √ They shouldn't need to share a lock anymore, now that we've closely coupled ImageLibrary and RecordStore
    
    √ ImageLibrary: what happens if: Thread2: reserve() ; Thread1: remove(), sync() ; Thread2: add()
        - We now forbid calling sync() between the reserve() / add() calls
    
    √ MSPApp: if MSPApp aborts, ICE40 will be in an unknown state. so when cold-starting,
      we should explicitly disable both Img and SD.
        - This is only necessary for the current design where ICE40 needs to keep running.
          In the future ICE40 power will be controlled by MSP430 and therefore will automatically reset.
    
    √ STMApp: get compiling again after Task/SDCard/etc changes
    
    √ MSPApp: test capturing images / get working again
    
    √ ICEAppSim: implement `sdClkObserved` without killing performance
    
    √ MSPApp: upon a cold start (which includes aborts) or if _state.sd.valid==false, refresh the SD card ID (CID). If the CID doesn't match the one stored in MSP::State, reset the ring buffers / capacity
    
    √ MSPApp: delay before actual abort, so we don't restart too quickly if too many aborts happen too quickly
    
    √ Let RTC run even if startTime is invalid? it would be nice if abort events have a non-zero time, even if it's not correct
    
    √ MSPApp: make FRAM data structure resilient to power loss during modifications
        - Strategy:
            - Have 2 copies of the `img` data structure
            - Use a checksum, and use the one with the greatest `count` that also has a valid checksum
    
    √ MSPApp: update img ring buffer data structure properly when captuing image
    
    √ MSPApp: add ability to read FRAM regions
        - necessary for:
            - setting MSP time
            - reading image ring buffer
            - writing image ring buffer
            - setting SD card size / ring buffer size
        - have a shared header containing the data structures
    
    √ MSPApp: when an error occurs, trigger a BOR
        - "In an application, it may be desired to cause a BOR in software. Setting PMMSWBOR
           causes a softwaredriven BOR. PMMBORIFG is set accordingly. Note that a BOR also initiates a POR and PUC.
           PMMBORIFG can be cleared by software or by reading SYSRSTIV."
    
    √ MSPApp: add proper error handling to Img/SD
        - Make error handler a template parameter
        - Have error handler take a breadcrumb value
        - Store abort history in a persistent data structure
    
    √ MSPApp: there's some bug where the LED stays lit for much longer than it should.
        √ is Task::Sleep() sleeping too long due to a race condition?
            - Should be fixed by Toastbox commit a5b9f73
    
    √ Buy TPS2116DRLR on Mouser?
        1580 Expected 2/3/2022
        3630 Expected 3/7/2022
    
    √ STLoader/STApp: rename MSP430 -> MSP430JTAG? MSPJTAG?
    
    √ STLoader/STApp: move target-specific USB.cpp into USBBase.h
        - We just need to supply the USB descriptor to USBBase right?
    
    √ STLoader/STApp: get abort to blink LEDs even before the system is initialized,
      so that there's a clear sign of failure even if the failure occurs early in
      system startup
    
    √ STApp: migrate to use real threads
    
    √ STApp: replace uses of HAL_Delay with Scheduler::Sleep
    
    √ STLoader: cleanup
    
    √ STLoader/STApp: make BufQueue fully templated on the buffers themselves
    
    √ STLoader/STApp: make QSPI a template
    
    √ STLoader: replace uses of HAL_Delay with Scheduler::Sleep
    
    √ STLoader: migrate to use real threads
    
    √ Task.h: debug feature: detecting stack overflows
        √ Include support for detecting stack overflows on the main stack too, due to interrupt handlers using lots of stack
    
    √ MSPApp: make SD::Card / Img::Sensor / ICE classes templated
    
    √ MSPApp: we should initialize the image sensor and SD card in parallel to save time
        - protothreads? cooperative threads?
    
    √ MSPApp: Implement power-saving version of delayUs/delayMs that uses the timer peripheral, and makes the CPU go to sleep
    
    √ MSPApp: don't wait for SD/IMG to be initialized in _SetSDImgEnabled(); only wait for them when we actually need to use them
    
    X MSPApp: move _SDTask/_ImgTask into SDCard.h and ImgSensor.h
    
    √ MSPApp: add SleepMs/SleepUs functions to Scheduler
    
    √ MSPApp: Make SDCard/ImgSensor take a Scheduler template parameter
    
    √ MSPApp: migrate implementation to use real threads
    
    √ STLoader: fix issue where MDCUtil's 'mspload' can't get MSP430 to run program if CCS previously loaded a program that entered LPM3.5
    
    √ MSPApp: Set initial exposure before we start streaming, so we don't need to skip a frame on the first one
    
    √ MSPApp: use skipCount=0 for the first frame, assuming setting the exposure before streaming starts is kosher
    
    X MSPApp: is there a way to make MDCUtil cause a full MSP430 reset when doing a mspload?
        - Currently after doing a mspload, PMMIFG.PMMLPM5IFG=1, so it's not a full reset
        - Also, the RTC peripheral doesn't get reset, so if it was previously running, it continues running
        - ReleaseDevice_430Xv2() mentions BOR, does our MSP430 support it?
        - Remove ColdStart() FRAM check if this works
        X No way to issue a full reset, since some RTC/PMM registers are only reset on an actual brownout, not a BOR
            - https://e2e.ti.com/support/microcontrollers/msp-low-power-microcontrollers-group/msp430/f/msp-low-power-microcontroller-forum/1061452/msp430fr2422-full-reset-including-rtc
    
    √ STLoader: cleanup tasks the way we did for STApp
    
    √ STApp / STLoader: in cases where the device reboots (STLoader: `STMReset` command,
      STApp: `Bootloader` command), can we wait until the host receives the command
      acceptance to actually reset, so the host doesn't get an error for the command?
          √ Implemented
    
    √ Fix bug: With STLink connected, sometimes the USB device doesn't enumerate when connecting the USB cable
        - Solutions:
            √ when USB is re-connected, have USB require an acknowledgement (USB::connect()) before
              permitting USB transactions
                - if a USB method is called before the acknowledgement, short-circuit / return an error
            
            √ when USB is disconnected (suspended), reset the USB stack
            
            X keep ints disabled while running tasks
                - have QSPI ready() poll the hardware register, instead of relying on
                  ints, so that ints don't need to be enabled
                    - we should be able to delete the _busy flag
                    - we should be able to delete HAL_QSPI_CmdCpltCallback() etc
        
        - Reasons not to have ints disabled while tasks are running:
            - HAL_Delay() is broken when ints are disabled
                - We'll lose track of time if ints are disabled for longer than 1ms
            - QSPI needs ints to be enabled for the QSPI::wait() (and the _busy flag) to work correctly
                - We might be able to work around this though
    
    √ ICEAppMSP: optimize perf back to previous levels
        √ Option1: Have ImgController write in full blocks
        X Option2: Bring back small state machine and trigger SD DatOut when r_thresh ('is 1 entire block available?') is asserted, but SDController monitors r_ready ('is any data available?')
        X ImgController: try going back to registering solution, instead of connecting RAMController directly to readout port?
    
    X ImgController: configure whether readout is stopped automatically or continues indefinitely?
        √ We ended up modifying ImgController to hard-code the image and readout lengths, so
          now ICEApp controls how much data is read out, ensuring that it's over the AFIFOChain
          read threshold, thereby fixing the ImgReadoutToSPI hang issue
        X Allowing readout to continue indefinitely would fix the ImgReadoutToSPI hang issue,
          caused by the 8x FIFO not being half full
        X If we allow it to continue indefinitely, can it be reset properly?
    
    √ ICEApp: fix simulation warning:
        /home/dave/repos/MDC/Code/ICE40/Shared/ImgController.v:72: warning: Port 3 (cmd_block) of RAMController expects 11 bits, got 1.
        /home/dave/repos/MDC/Code/ICE40/Shared/ImgController.v:72:        : Padding 10 high bits of the port.
    
    √ AFIFOChain: the r_thresh signal can't be in the r_clk domain for the ReadoutToSPI cases,
      because STM32 won't be driving the clock while it's waiting for data to become available.
      So we need an async version of the signal, along with synchronous versions for internal use.
    
    √ Investigate: why did ICEAppMSP design size balloon?
        - What did it used to be?
            - As a result of using the 8x AFIFO chain in ICEAppMSP, the design went from: 2735 (35%) -> 3661 (47%) LUTs
        - Is it just AFIFOChain?
            - Yes
    
    √ ICEApp.v: consider removing readout FIFO from ImgController, and replace with FIFO chain
        - This would clean up the design because in the ICEApp_ImgReadoutToSPI_En case, ImgController
          has a readout FIFO, which is connected directly to the AFIFO chain, so it's redundant.
        √ This might allow us to remove ImgController's `readout_start` signal (which controls
          SDController.datOut_trigger) in favor of using the FIFO chain's `readoutfifo_prop_r_ready`
          signal instead, since the purpose of `readout_start` is to signal when there's enough
          data in the FIFO such that SDController can start writing
          
            √ We ended up removing readout_start
            
            X Use a FIFO chain with 2x FIFOs in this case, so that `readoutfifo_prop_r_ready`
              signifies that 512 bytes are available (ie 1 complete SD block)
            
                X Nevermind, we're using the full 8x FIFOs and sticking with the strategy
                  where SDController checks for any data being available to write, instead
                  of checking whether a full block is available.
        
        √ We'll probably need to add a `readout_rst` signal to clear the output FIFO
            - This is nice because it mirror's SDController's `datInWrite_rst`
            √ We ended up adding a readout_rst signal
            X Assert readout_rst when capturing an image, not upon readout, so that the FIFO is
              guaranteed empty when we start readout?
                X But that breaks the case where we perform successive readouts without capturing.
        
        √ Does this speed up the affected designs (ICEAppMSP / ICEAppImgCaptureSTM)?
            √ It did increase perf somewhat
    
    √ Investigate: ImgController: reconsider whether we should hard-code the ImageSize for readout purposes
        - If we allow readout to be configured to continue indefinitely, then we don't need to hardcode the image size
        √ Switched back to previous strategy where we readout the number of words that we counted during capturing
    
    √ Investigate: ImgController: does `ctrl_readoutCount` underflow when simulating ICEAppMSP?
        X No, it doesn't
        - Why does it underflow when running `./Sim.sh ICEAppImgCaptureSTM` ? ("[ImgController] ctrl_readoutCount: 1507")
            - Because ImgController doesn't transition to the "Ctrl_State_Readout+2" state until the FIFO is full,
              and it keeps getting drained because of the 8x AFIFO chain
    
    √ Add checksum to the end of images
        - Ended up using Fletcher-32 checksum.
            - Ideally we'd use a CRC, but we can't because they're computed a bit at a time,
              and our data is incoming at 16-bits per clock. So we use a checksum instead
              since it can be computed a 16-bit word at a time.
    
    √ ICEAppMSP: add image counter to image header, so software can keep track of which images have already been downloaded
    
    √ ICEAppMSP: re-implement capturing the CMD6 access mode
    
    √ ICEAppMSP
        √ Reset SDController DatOut before a new capture starts filling the FIFO
        X ImgController: stop reading from RAM beyond the last image pixel
            - Nevermind, it requires too much combinational logic without any benefit of doing so.
              We would only want to do this if it would save us from writing an additional SD block,
              but it doesn't, so it's not worth the complexity and perf slowdown.
    
    √ STLoader / STApp: add ability to reset DataIn endpoint, which sends 2 ZLPs + sentinel
        √ Automatically reset each time we send the SDRead command
        X Should every command that sends data automatically reset the DataIn endpoint? For example, what about STLoader commands that send data?
            X No, only reset at the beginning of comms. Otherwise it adds a lot of overhead.
            √ Quantify: how much overhead does it add to send the reset sequence (2 ZLPs + sentinel)?
                - Without reset sequence:   180 us
                - With reset sequence:      422 us
    
    √ STLoader / STApp: Move commands to default control endpoint
        - This will save space in the limited FIFO RAM
        - This will also help improve our command/response scheme since EP0 gets replies for every request
    
    √ SDController: Implement SD card reading
        - Requirements
            √ Read 512x1 transfers (for CMD6)
            √ Read 4096xN transfers (for reading mass data)
            √ Stop clock between N blocks if the FIFO doesn't have space
                - Clock requirements
                    - Internal: Manual control of sd_clk (for LVS init sequence)
                    - External: Switch between clk_slow and clk_fast (after initializing SD card)
                    - Internal: Disable sd_clk output (to delay reading until space is available)
            √ Always write into FIFO when doing DatIn
            √ Reset FIFO when performing new DatIn transfer
            √ Move CMD6 access mode detection to client so ICEAppMSP can keep track of it, instead of SDController
    
    √ Figure out STApp/ICEAppSTM SD data comms scheme
        - Requirements
            √ Start SD data transfer
                √ Use regular messages
            √ Terminate SD data transfer
                √ Use chip select
            √ Signal whether SD data is available
                √ Use separate pin
                - Use ICE_ST_SPI_D0
                    - Problem: ICE_ST_SPI_Dx uses clocked registers, so a clock is needed to change their value
                    - Solutions:
                        - Use OUTPUT_ENABLE, which isn't clocked
                            - STM32: enable pull-down resistor
                            - ICE40: OUTPUT_ENABLE=1
                            - ICE40: drive ICE_ST_SPI_D0 low to remove remaining voltage
                            - ICE40: OUTPUT_ENABLE=0
                            - ICE40: spi_doutReg=~0
                            - ICE40: wait for data available
                            - ICE40: OUTPUT_ENABLE=1
                        
                        - Switch ice_st_spi_d's OUTPUT_CLK
                            - Glitching could be an issue
    
    √ Get saving images to SD card working, especially with LVS SD initialization
        √ Working at 50MHz, need to try at higher frequencies
        √ Working at 102MHz. Not stress tested yet though -- may need to tweak delay.
    
    √ Get LVS SD initialization test working
        - Determined that:
            - SD card samples all signals (sd_cmd+sd_dat[3:0]), so all 5 signals need to be driven to 0V
            - SD card samples signal levels at negative edge of sd_clk, so they need to be driven
              a little longer than the negative edge.
            - SD card drives sd_dat[2] 33us after the negative edge of sd_clk, so we need to stop
              driving lines before then

    √ Get MSP430 comms working with ICE40
    
    √ Get crystal working with MSP430
    
    √ STLoader: add interface for writing MSP430 firmware
        √ We ended up overhauling everything and didn't end up adding a new interface, but MSP430 flashing is working well
    
    √ Don't we need to tell the image sensor the input frequency?
        Yes, updated image sensor configuration in MDCDevice.h
    
    √ Verify that image sensor clock is blocked when the rails are off
    
    √ Get image streaming to Mac working
        √ ICEStreamApp
    
    √ Update ICE40 to use 16 MHz clock, instead of 24 MHz
    
    √ Fix MSP_RST_/MSP_TEST logic levels
        *** Before bodging, just try programming MSP first. It's possible that 1.8V will meet MSP's Vih ***
            XXX JTAG doesn't work
        √ Option: add 10k resistor pullups to VDD_A, remove 1nF capacitor + 47k resistor, and have STM32 use open-drain signalling
            Works!
        - Option: Sever the MSP_RST_/MSP_TEST connections to MSP, wire them to MSPLevelShifter, then wire the output back to the MSP_RST_/MSP_TEST pins?
        - Option: Bodge STM_LED0/STM_LED1 -> MSPLevelShifter -> MSP_RST_/MSP_TEST
    
    √ Get programming MSP430 from STM32 working
    
    √ Verilog: Rename PIX -> IMG
    
    √ Get RAM working with ICE40
        √ RAMReadWriteTest
        √ RAMReadWriteRandomlyTest
    
    √ Verilog: Update SDRAM controller for new part (Winbond -> Alliance)
    
    √ Fix MSP level shifter net names on schematic:
        √ ICE_MSP_SPI_CLK is actually ICE_MSP_SPI_DATA
        √ ICE_MSP_SPI_DATA is actually ICE_MSP_SPI_CLK
    
    √ Swap motion sensor VDD/GND pins when soldering
    
    √ Update STM32 to use 16 MHz clock, instead of 24 MHz
    
    √ Bodge VDD_A to 2V8 so that MSP430 is powered properly
    
    √ Test whether we can get LVS identification working
        - It works!
        - See SDLVSTest-Scheme5
        - Need to implement in SDController.v
    
    √ We may need to speed up pix_dclk to get some more headroom to comfortably hit 108MHz
        √ Optimizing highlight/shadow counting appears to help significantly. Options:
            √ 1. Add pipelining, particularly the `fifoIn_write_trigger && !fifoIn_x && !fifoIn_y` boolean chain. Store that boolean in a register to be read on the next clock cycle
            2. Move highlight/shadow counting out of PixController and into a separate command issued to ICE40, specifically for calculating stats on the image stored in RAM
    
    X If we end up removing SD card pullups in favor of ice40 internal ones:
        - Make sure these pullups are enabled on the SB_IO instantiation
            - Nevermind, we kept the pullups




- Rev4 Board Test Checklist
    - Verify that the clock-blocking buffer blocks the clock to IMG when VDD_1V9_IMG=0
    
    - Verify that when battery powered:
        VDD_A = VDD_BAT
        VDD_B = HiZ / VDD_BAT (controlled by MSP)
    
    - Verify that when USB powered:
        VDD_A = 1.9V
        VDD_B = VDD_USB - V_diode_forward ~= 4.5V
