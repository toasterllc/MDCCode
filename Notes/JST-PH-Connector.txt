JST PH Connector

* Background

    Apparently the official JST female receptacles often don't fit well with the connectors attached to most batteries,
    because the channel on top of the battery's male connector is too wide to fit in the notch in the female receptacle.
    
    We experienced this problem with the battery we ordered for the Current Ranger, where the battery's male connector
    was a very tight fit into the Current Ranger's female receptacle.

    So instead of ordering the official JST receptacle, we'll order a clone, and try to find one with a wider notch.

    Apparently good options:
        HX20007-2AWB (lots of quantity, but notch looks a little thin)
        HDGC2001WR-S-2P (notch looks wide)
