* PNY Elite-X 64 GB
    √ LVS init works
    X CMD6 fails (after LVS init) when trying to switch to SDR104
        - CMD6 works fine when doing 3.3V init
        - Haven't been able to root cause
        - For now we simply can't get to SDR104 when doing LVS init, so are options are either:
            - Use legacy 3.3V init, or
            - Don't support this card
    
    - Write image current consumption
        171 mA
    
    - Write image duration
