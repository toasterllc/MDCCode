`master` contains work for the board revision being actively developed, RevX.

A new tag `board/RevX` is created when the RevX schematic/layout is finalized
and the PCB is ordered.

A new branch `dev/RevX` is created from `master` immediately before modifying the
schematic/layout for the RevX+1 board.

    If the schematic/layout must be modified for RevX+1 before development for
    RevX has completed (and therefore RevX development continues in `master`),
    the `init/RevX+1` branch should be created in advance to hold the
    schematic/layout modifications. The `init/RevX+1` branch must be kept
    up-to-date with `master` using the `git rebase master` command. When the
    time comes for `master` to transition to RevX+1 development, the
    schematic/layout modifications should be applied to `master` using
    `git rebase init/RevX+1`, after which `init/RevX+1` should no longer be
    used.
